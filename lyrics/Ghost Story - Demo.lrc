Hold on now
In my defense
You didn't make it easy for me
And I know, I know
I'm not heaven sent
I'm just sayin that we didn't have to
Wait another year
We're waiting out of fear
So hold onto me
Hold onto me my dear
We're waitin out of life
Waiting out of spite
So hold onto me
Hold onto me my dear
Before you ignore me
Please tuck me in
This is a ghost story
